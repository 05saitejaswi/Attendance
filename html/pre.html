       <p  class="d-none d-sm-block " style="color:blueviolet"> Violence against women can fit into several broad categories. These include violence
         carried out by individuals as well as states. Some of the forms of violence perpetrated 
        by individuals are: rape, domestic violence, sexual harassment, acid throwing, reproductive
         coercion, female infanticide, prenatal sex selection, obstetric violence, and mob violence;
         as well as harmful customary or traditional practices such as honor killings, dowry 
        violence, female genital mutilation, marriage by abduction and forced marriage. 
        There are forms of violence which may be perpetrated or condoned by the government,
         such as war rape; sexual violence and sexual slavery during conflict; forced sterilization;
         forced abortion; violence by the police and authoritative personnel; stoning and flogging.
         Many forms of VAW, such as trafficking in women and forced prostitution are often 
        perpetrated by organized criminal networks.[6] Histrorically, there have been forms of 
        organized WAV, such as the Witch trials in the early modern period or the sexual slavery
         of the Comfort women.
        
        The World Health Organization (WHO), in its research on VAW, has analyzed and categorized the different forms of VAW occurring through all stages of life from before birth to old age.

                    Women are most often the victims of rape, which is usually perpetrated by men known to them.[55] The rate of reporting, prosecution and convictions for rape varies considerably in different jurisdictions, and reflects to some extent the society's attitudes to such crimes. It is considered the most underreported violent crime.[56][57] Following a rape, a victim may face violence or threats of violence from the rapist, and, in many cultures, from the victim's own family and relatives. Violence or intimidation of the victim may be perpetrated by the rapist or by friends and relatives of the rapist, as a way of preventing the victims from reporting the
                     rape, of punishing them for reporting it, or of forcing them to withdraw the complaint; or it may be
                      perpetrated by the relatives of the victim as a punishment for "bringing shame" to the family. This
                       is especially the case in cultures where female virginity is highly valued and considered mandatory
                        before marriage; in extreme cases, rape victims are killed in honor killings. Victims may also be 
                        forced by their families to marry the rapist in order to restore the family's "honor".[58] In Lebanon, 
                        the Campaign Against Lebanese Rape Law - Article 522 was launched in December 2016 to abolish the article
                         that permitted a rapist to escape prison by marrying his victim.Internationally, the incidence of rapes recorded by police during 2008 varied between 0.1 per 100,000 people in Egypt and 91.6 per 100,000 people in Lesotho with 4.9 per 100,000 people in Lithuania as the median.[59] In some countries, rape is not reported or 
                    properly recorded by police because of the consequences on the victim and the stigma attached to it</p>

                    Domestic violence
                     (also named domestic abuse or family violence) is violence or other abuse in a domestic setting, such as in 
                     marriage or cohabitation. Domestic violence may be used as a synonym for intimate partner violence, which 
                     is committed by a spouse or partner in an intimate relationship against the other spouse or partner, 
                     and can take place in heterosexual or same-sex relationships, or between former spouses or partners. 
                     In the broadest sense, domestic violence can also involve violence against children, parents,
                      or the elderly.</p>

                An acid attack,[1] also called acid throwing, vitriol attack, or vitriolage, is a form of violent assault[2][3][4] involving the act of throwing acid or a similarly corrosive substance onto the body of another "with the intention to disfigure, maim, torture, or kill".[5] Perpetrators of these attacks throw corrosive liquids at their victims, usually at their faces, burning them, and damaging skin tissue, often exposing and sometimes dissolving the bones.
